# GW2-Calculator

## What is this?
GW2-Calculator is a simple designed python3-app with PyQt5. It is made for the videogame [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com "Guild Wars 2") to discover new meta or fun builds. Inspiration comes from [gw2skills.net](http://gw2skills.net/editor/  "gw2skills.net"), a build creator. Gw2skills.net shows the stats of an own created build, but what does this numbers means? How much is my damage output? How long do I need to kill the enemy. How many hits can I survive?
Well, these questions are very theoretical, but this app will answer these questions. If you love stratgical tactical thoughs and you are affin withs numbers, you should take a closer look to this app.
